Here's a sample documentation for my project that includes **sign up**, **sign in**, **reset password**, and a **dashboard** with **customers** and **tickets** sections. It uses **ReactJS** for the frontend, **NodeJS**, **ExpressJS**, **MySQL** for the backend, and utilizes **REST APIs**. The API is also tested using **Postman**. And iam working on it to improve the things

# User Management & Dashboard System

This project is a full-stack web application with **User Authentication** (Sign Up, Sign In, Reset Password) and a **Dashboard** that displays **Customers** and **Tickets**. The frontend is built with **ReactJS** while the backend is powered by **NodeJS** and **ExpressJS**, using **MySQL** as the database. The application interacts with **REST APIs** for communication between frontend and backend.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-dashboard.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd user-dashboard/frontend
   ```
   
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

---

## Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-dashboard.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd user-dashboard/backend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure MySQL**:
   - Create a MySQL database and tables using the provided schema (the SQL queries should be in a `database.sql` file).
   - Update your MySQL credentials in the `.env` file.

5. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

      },
      ...
    ]
    ```

## Testing with Postman

You can test all the API endpoints using **Postman**.

1. **Authentication Endpoints**:
   - Test the **Sign Up**, **Sign In**, and **Reset Password** endpoints by sending the corresponding HTTP requests (POST requests).
   - Make sure to test with both valid and invalid data for each endpoint.
   
2. **Dashboard Endpoints**:
   - After successfully logging in and obtaining a token, use it in the **Authorization** tab of Postman as a Bearer token for protected routes (like `/api/dashboard/customers` and `/api/dashboard/tickets`).

### Best Practices & Tips

- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in both frontend and backend to provide meaningful error messages.
- **Security**: Use **bcrypt** for password hashing and **JWT** for token authentication in the backend.
- **Testing**: Continuously test your API using **Postman** and ensure that your frontend interacts correctly with the API.
- **Styling**: Utilize **Bootstrap** components in the frontend for responsive and modern design.
